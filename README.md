## Ajax and API's

1. [Read this article](http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/) on how Ajax became Ajax

2. Using what we learned in todays API Lesson, we are going to create a sinatra app that will display our gif from the parameters set forth by the form. 
	- Create a view with a form for our user to search from.
	- Use [HTTParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty) to query the [giphy API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI) to get back a random gif using the parameter set from the user in the form field from the view.
	- Grab the appropriate value from the data provided by the giphy API and display your newly generated gif onto a new view! (Or if you want you can have it display to the same view as the form field).
